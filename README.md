## Description

In this activity, I refactored a base of starter code to follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. This included ensuring the code has semantic HTML elements, which follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, as well as giving the page a descriptive title and giving images accessible alt attributes.
